**Culex tarsalis Genome Analysis**
<br>North Carolina Research Campus [Kannapolis, North Carolina]
<br>[(Repository: Culex-tarsalis)](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)

     Assisted my PI in researching local adaptation and range expansion in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes through use of a combination 
     of bioinformatics tools (GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.) and programming languages (SQLite, R, bash, Python3)
     to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes.
     
**Pandas SARS-CoV-2 Project**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics [Charlotte, North Carolina]
<br>[(Repository: Pandas SARS-CoV-2 Project)](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Pandas_SARS-CoV-2_Project-/blob/main/Pandas%20SARS-CoV-2%20Project.ipynb)

     Created a demo for utilizing Pandas when working with SARS-CoV-2 computational research/database data.
