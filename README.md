# Education :mortar_board:
***
**Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Genomics** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The University of North Carolina at Charlotte

     The coursework focused on programming, statistical analysis, and database management in bioinformatics, covering 
     Python, R, and SQL for data processing, algorithm development, and research applications. Key topics included sequence 
     alignment, molecular data analysis, phylogenetics, machine learning, and database modeling, with an emphasis on
     practical implementation using computational tools and open-source software.

**Bachelor of Arts in Biology** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The University of North Carolina at Charlotte
     
     Minors: Statistics and Bioinformatics

     The coursework covered foundational and advanced statistical methods, including probability models, inference 
     techniques, regression analysis, and experimental design. Emphasis was placed on applying these concepts to 
     real-world data, particularly in bioinformatics, using computational tools.

# Past Projects :computer:

**[Culex tarsalis Genome Analysis](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)**
<br>North Carolina Research Campus &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Kannapolis, North Carolina

     Assisted my PI in researching local adaptation and range expansion in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes through use of a 
     combination of bioinformatics tools (GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.) and programming languages 
     (SQLite, R, bash, Python3) to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes.
     
**[SARS-CoV-2 Project](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Pandas_SARS-CoV-2_Project-/blob/main/Pandas%20SARS-CoV-2%20Project.ipynb)**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlotte, North Carolina

     Created a demo for utilizing Pandas when working with SARS-CoV-2 computational research/database data.
