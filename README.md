# About Me 👋
***
Welcome to my page! I am @Samantha-A-Taylor, a bioinformatics graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I have a strong passion for numbers, statistical analysis, and data science, and I enjoy working with complex datasets. Skilled in SQL, R, and Python, I apply computational and analytical techniques to solve biological and data-driven problems. This page highlights my projects and past work as I continue exploring the intersection of data science and bioinformatics.

# Projects :computer:

**[Student Performance Analytics and Trend Analysis | March Madness Reading Challenge](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/StudentPerformanceAnalyticsAndTrend-AnalysisMarchMadnessReadingChallenge2025)**
<br>Cabarrus County Schools &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Concord, North Carolina

      Explored K–5 student reading log data from the March Madness Reading Challenge using Python, Pandas, 
      Seaborn, and Matplotlib.pyplot. Conducted EDA to track weekly reading trends, identify top performers 
      and at-risk students, and analyze class-level distributions and outliers to generate actionable insights.

**[IBM Course Certification Final Project](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/IBM_Databases_and_SQL_Course_Certificate_Work)**
<br>Certification Program Developed by IBM, Completed on Coursera

     My IBM Course Certification Final Project demo covering Data Analysis of Public School Data, Crime Data, and 
     Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago Community Areas.

**[Misc. Bioinformatics Micro-Projects](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/MiscBinfMicroProjects)**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlotte, North Carolina

     Graduate-level bioinformatics and phylogenetics research projects involving Bayesian and maximum likelihood 
     inference, coalescent species tree estimation, ancestral state reconstruction, molecular clock dating, gene 
     flow testing, and genetic distance modeling using R, R Markdown, RAxML, MrBayes, ASTRAL, phytools, phangorn, 
     MUSCLE, Clustal-Omega, and HPC-based workflows.

**[Culex tarsalis Genome Analysis](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)**
<br>North Carolina Research Campus &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Kannapolis, North Carolina

     Research of local adaptation and range expansion in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes through use of a combination of 
     bioinformatics tools [GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.] and programming languages [SQL, R, Python] 
     to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes.
     
**[SARS-CoV-2 Project](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Pandas_SARS-CoV-2_Project-/blob/main/Pandas%20SARS-CoV-2%20Project.ipynb)**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlotte, North Carolina

     A demo for utilizing Pandas when working with SARS-CoV-2 computational research/database data.
