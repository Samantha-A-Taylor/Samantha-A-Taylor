# About Me 👋
***
Welcome to my page! I am @Samantha-A-Taylor, a bioinformatics graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I have a strong passion for numbers, statistical analysis, and data science, and I enjoy working with complex datasets. Skilled in SQL, R, and Python, I apply computational and analytical techniques to solve biological and data-driven problems. This page highlights my projects and past work as I continue exploring the intersection of data science and bioinformatics.


# Professional Projects :computer:

**[Sales Performance & Revenue Analysis KPI Trends, Product Insights, and Regional Performance](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/SalesPerformanceRevenueAnalysisKPITrendsProductInsightsAndRegionalPerformance/tree/main/)**
<br>Independent Project &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Remote

      Analyzed a synthetic, transaction-level retail sales dataset spanning 2022–2024 using Python, Pandas, 
      SQL/SQLite, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Conducted end-to-end EDA to evaluate revenue and profit KPIs, 
      product category performance, regional trends, discount impacts, and customer purchasing behavior, 
      generating actionable insights into sales drivers, operational efficiency, and business performance 
      across time and geography.


**[Multi-Factor Transaction Monitoring and Fraud Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Multi-FactorTransactionMonitoringAndFraudRiskAnalysis)**
<br>Independent Project &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Remote

      Analyzed a synthetic financial transaction dataset using SQL/SQLite and Tableau. Conducted end-to-end 
      exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine transaction amounts, frequency patterns, and login behavior. 
      Engineered multi-factor fraud metrics to flag high-risk transactions, scored accounts by combined 
      anomalies, and visualized behavioral and geographic patterns to generate actionable insights for 
      proactive fraud detection and transaction monitoring.  


**[Student Performance Analytics and Trend Analysis | March Madness Reading Challenge](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/StudentPerformanceAnalyticsAndTrendAnalysis-MarchMadnessReadingChallenge2025)**
<br>Cabarrus County Schools &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Concord, North Carolina

      Explored K–5 student reading log data from the March Madness Reading Challenge using Python, Pandas, 
      Seaborn, and Matplotlib.pyplot. Conducted EDA to track weekly reading trends, identify top performers 
      and at-risk students, and analyze class-level distributions and outliers to generate actionable insights.


**[Quantitative Analysis of Socioeconomic Indicators, Crime, and Educational Outcomes in Chicago Communities](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/QuantitativeAnalysisOfSocioeconomicIndicatorsCrimeAndEducationalOutcomesInChicagoCommunities)**
<br>Independent Project &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Remote

      Conducted community-level analysis of Chicago census, public school, and crime datasets using Python, Pandas, 
      Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SQLite3. Performed EDA to explore distributions, temporal and spatial trends, and 
      correlations across socioeconomic, crime, and educational metrics, generating actionable insights for 
      policymakers and educators.


**[COVID-19 Case Trends and State-Level Analysis in the United States | Summer 2020 Dynamics](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/COVID-19CaseTrendsAndState-LevelAnalysisInTheUS)**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlotte, North Carolina

       Explored US COVID-19 confirmed case data from March through September 2020 using Python, Pandas, 
       and Matplotlib. Conducted EDA to track state-level trends, calculate numerical and percentage increases, 
       compute weekly average case growth, and analyze proportions of national cases, generating actionable 
       insights into pandemic dynamics across states and territories.

**[Misc. Bioinformatics Micro-Projects](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/MiscBinfMicroProjects)**
<br>UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlotte, North Carolina

     Graduate-level bioinformatics and phylogenetics research projects involving Bayesian and maximum likelihood 
     inference, coalescent species tree estimation, ancestral state reconstruction, molecular clock dating, gene 
     flow testing, and genetic distance modeling using R, R Markdown, RAxML, MrBayes, ASTRAL, phytools, phangorn, 
     MUSCLE, Clustal-Omega, and HPC-based workflows.


**[Local Adaptation and Range Expansion in _Culex tarsalis_: Comparative Genomics and Population-Level Analysis​](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)**
<br>North Carolina Research Campus &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Kannapolis, North Carolina

     Research of local adaptation and range expansion in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes through use of a combination of 
     bioinformatics tools [GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.] and programming languages [SQL, R, Python] 
     to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes. 


# Creative Projects :sparkles:
