Hello and welcome to my introduction page. I am @Samantha-A-Taylor, a bioinformatician and recent M.S. graduate from the University of North Carolina - Charlotte as of May 2022. I have a range of computational skills that I have aquired over the last 4 years, and am proficient in:

     - Python3/Pandas
     - SQL/SQLite
     - R/Rstudio
     - Bash/Unix

**Culex tarsalis Genome Analysis** - North Carolina Research Campus - Kannapolis, North Carolina [(Repository: Culex-tarsalis)](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)

     - Assisted my PI in researching local adaptation and range expansion in *Culex tarsalis* mosquitoes through use of a combination 
     of bioinformatics tools (GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.) and programming languages (SQLite, R, bash, Python3)
     to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes.
     
**Pandas SARS-CoV-2 Project** - UNCC's College of Computing and Informatics - Charlotte, North Carolina [(Repository: Pandas SARS-CoV-2 Project)](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Pandas_SARS-CoV-2_Project-/blob/main/Pandas%20SARS-CoV-2%20Project.ipynb)

     - Created a demo for utalizing Pandas when working with SARS-CoV-2 computational research/database data.
