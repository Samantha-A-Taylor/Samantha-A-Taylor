**Culex tarsalis Genome Analysis** - North Carolina Research Campus - Kannapolis, North Carolina [(Repository: Culex-tarsalis)](https://github.com/Samantha-A-Taylor/Culex-tarsalis)

     - Assisted my PI in researching local adaptation and range expansion in *Culex tarsalis* mosquitoes through use of a combination 
     of bioinformatics tools (GenMap, OrthoFinder, UniFunc, InterProScan, etc.) and programming languages (SQLite, R, bash, Python3)
     to analyze and troubleshoot the sample data and reference genomes.
